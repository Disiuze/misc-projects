Miscellaneous Projects for Endless Sky

Currently there are three mods:
1. Androids
	This mod reimplements the android but with a few balancing fixes.
2. Automation Systems
	This mod implements a new outfit which automates a ship. Requires a karma higher than 2 during the Free Worlds story.
3. Landing Fees and Tax
	This mod implements a system which makes you pay a fee when landing and a ship tax.
	Currently, human planets only require you to pay fees after the third initial deployment event.
